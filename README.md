A cinematic and realistic night-time scene on a deserted beach. A sad man sits motionless on the wet sand, wearing dark, mysterious clothing. On his back is clearly written in bold English text: “Generation Jail”. The camera is fixed — no movement or zoom. The weather is stormy: heavy rain is falling realistically with visible drops and ground reflections. Dark clouds drift slowly across the sky. In the distance, the mythical Loch Ness monster is visible, still and watching, rising slightly from the calm but slowly moving ocean waves. The sea moves gently and realistically under a glowing full moon. The lighting is dramatic yet soft, casting realistic shadows and reflections. The overall scene has a 3D cinematic feel, ultra-high-definition texture, and a deep, melancholic atmosphere. No camera movement, no character motion, only rain, clouds, and water gently animated for realism. Output format: 16:9 aspect ratio, 1920x1080 resolution, cinematic framing for YouTube.
